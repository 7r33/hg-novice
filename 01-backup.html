<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<li>Explain which initialization and configuration steps are required once per machine, and which are required once per repository.</li>
<li>Add files to Mercurial's collection of tracked files.</li>
<li>Go through the modify-commit cycle for single and multiple files and explain where information is stored before and after the commit.</li>
<li>Identify and use Mercurial revision numbers and changeset identifiers.</li>

<li>Restore old versions of files.</li>
<li>Configure Mercurial to ignore specific files, and explain why it is sometimes useful to do so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We'll start by exploring how version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when. Even if you aren't collaborating with other people, version control is much better for that than this:</p>

</div>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h3>
<p>The first time we use Mercurial on a new machine, we need to configure a few things.</p>
<p>Dracula sets up his new Windows laptop by using his editor to create a new file called <code>%USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini</code> (that's spelled <code>$USERPROFILE/Mercurial.ini</code> if you are in <code>gitbash</code>) containing the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>[ui]
username = Vlad Dracula &lt;vlad@tran.sylvan.ia&gt;
editor = nano

[extensions]
color =

[color]
mode = win32</code></pre>
<p>Wolfman has both a Mac laptop and a Linux one and he uses his editor to create a new file called <code>~/.hgrc</code> on both of those machines with the same contents:</p>
<pre><code>[ui]
username = Jack Wolfman &lt;jack@cali.forn.ia&gt;
editor = nano

[extensions]
color =</code></pre>
<p>(Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's or Wolfman's, and make sure you choose an editor that's actually on your system, such as <code>notepad</code> on Windows.)</p>
<p>Those configuration file settings tell Mercurial:</p>
<ul>
<li>our name and email address,</li>
<li>what our favorite text editor is, and</li>
<li>to colorize output.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that these settings are in the Mercurial configuration file in our home directory means that they will be used for every project on this machine. This bit of setup only needs to be done once.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a Repository</h3>
<p>Once Mercurial is configured, we can start using it. Let's create a directory for our work:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets</code></pre>
<p>and tell Mercurial to make it a <strong>repository</strong> --- a place where Mercurial can store old versions of our files:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg init</code></pre>
<p>Mercurial commands are written <code>hg verb</code>, where <code>verb</code> is what we actually want it to do.</p>
<p>If we use <code>ls</code> to show the directory's contents, it appears that nothing has changed:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<p>But if we add the <code>-a</code> flag to show everything, we can see that Mercurial has created a hidden directory called <code>.hg</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ ls -a</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>.   ..  .hg</code></pre>
<p>Mercurial stores information about the project in this special sub-directory. If we ever delete it, we will lose the project's history.</p>
<p>We can check that everything is set up correctly by asking Mercurial to verify the structure of our repository:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg verify</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>checking changesets
checking manifests
crosschecking files in changesets and manifests
checking files
0 files, 0 changesets, 0 total revisions</code></pre>
<h3 id="tracking-changes-to-files">Tracking Changes to Files</h3>
<p>Let's create a file called <code>mars.txt</code> that contains some notes about the Red Planet's suitability as a base. (We'll use <code>nano</code> to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like. In particular, this does not have to be the editor that you set in your Mercurial global configuration earlier.)</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ nano mars.txt</code></pre>
<p><code>mars.txt</code> has now been created and it contains a single line:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="input"><code>$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color</code></pre>
<p>We can ask Mercurial to tell us what it knows about the files in our project with the <code>hg status</code> command. Mercurial tells us that it's noticed the new file:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>? mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>The <code>?</code> at the beginning of the line means that Mercurial isn't keeping track of the file. We can tell Mercurial that it should do so using <code>hg add</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg add mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>and then check that the right thing happened:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>A mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>Mercurial now knows that it's supposed to keep track of <code>mars.txt</code>, but it hasn't yet recorded any changes for posterity as a commit. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg commit -m &quot;Starting to think about Mars&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When we run <code>hg commit</code>, Mercurial takes the file we have told it about by using <code>hg add</code> and stores a copy permanently inside the special <code>.hg</code> directory.</p>
<p>We use the <code>-m</code> flag (for &quot;message&quot;) to record a comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run <code>hg commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> option, Mercurial will launch <code>nano</code> (or whatever other editor we configured at the start) so that we can write a longer message.</p>
<p>If we run <code>hg status</code> now:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<p>we get no output because everything is up to date.</p>
<p>If we want to know what we've done recently, we can ask Mercurial to show us the project's history using <code>hg log</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg log</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>changeset:   0:72ab25fa99a1

<p><code>hg log</code> lists all changes committed to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each <strong>changeset</strong> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changeset's revision number and identifier (<code>0</code> and <code>72ab25fa99a1</code> in this case, but your identifier will likely be different),</li>
<li>its tags (more about tags later),</li>
<li>the changeset's author,</li>
<li>when it was created,</li>
<li>and the log message Mercurial was given when the changeset was created.</li>
</ul>
<p>The revision number is a convenient integer shorthand for the hexidecimal identifier.</p>
<div id="where-are-my-changes" class="callout">
<h2>Where Are My Changes?</h2>
<p>If we run <code>ls</code> at this point, we will still see just one file called <code>mars.txt</code>. That's because Mercurial saves information about files' history in the special <code>.hg</code> directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="changing-a-file">Changing a File</h3>
<p>Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file. (Again, we'll edit with <code>nano</code> and then <code>cat</code> the file to show its contents; you may use a different editor, and don't need to <code>cat</code>.)</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

<p>When we run <code>hg status</code> now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>M mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>The <code>M</code> at the beginning of the line means that Mercurial has noticed that we have modified the <code>mars.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>We can double-check our work using <code>hg diff</code>, which shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently committed version:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg diff</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>diff -r 72ab25fa99a1 mars.txt

<p>The output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and <code>patch</code> telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we can break it down into pieces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first line tells us that Mercurial is using the Unix <code>diff</code> command to compare the last committed and new versions of the file.</li>

<p>Of course sometimes we may not want to commit everything at once. For example, suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding addition to the bibliography, but <em>not</em> commit the work we're doing on the conclusions (which we haven't finished yet). To handle that, simply do two (or more) separate commits, listing the names of the files to be included in each commit in the <code>hg commit</code> command:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg commit -m &quot;Cite Frankenstein(2010) and Frankenstein, etal(2011).&quot; methods.txt biblio.txt
...
&lt;later&gt;
...
$ hg commit conclusions.txt -m &quot;Update conclusions re: sunlight.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the list of file names can come before or after the commit comment in the <code>hg commit</code> command.</p>
<p>Let's add another line to the file for practice and to make our revision history more interesting:</p>

<h3 id="recovering-old-versions">Recovering Old Versions</h3>
<p>All right: we can save changes to files and see what we've changed---how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>We will need to manufacture our own oxygen</code></pre>
<p><code>hg status</code> now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been committed:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>M mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>We can put things back the way they were by using <code>hg revert</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg revert mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess from its name, <code>hg revert</code> reverts to (i.e., restores) an old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Mercurial that we want to recover the last committed version of the file. If we want to go back even further, we can use the <code>--rev</code> or <code>-r</code> flag and a revision number instead:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg revert --rev 0 mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>Mercurial really doesn't want to cause us to lose our work, so it defaults to making a backup when we use <code>hg revert</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>? mars.txt.orig</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mars.txt.orig</code> file is a copy of <code>mars.txt</code> as it stood before the <code>hg revert</code> command. It's not tracked by Mercurial. It's just there in case we made a mistake and really didn't want to revert, or in case there's some content from before the revert that we decide that we really do want to copy into <code>mars.txt</code>. When we're sure that we don't need <code>*.orig</code> files we can just go ahead and delete them. If we really don't want Mercurial to create <code>*.orig</code> files when we use <code>hg revert</code>, we can use the <code>--no-backup</code> option, its short version <code>-C</code> or add</p>
<pre><code>[alias]
revert = revert --no-backup</code></pre>
<p>to your <code>~/.hgrc</code> (or<code>%USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini</code> if you are using Windows).</p>
<p>The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-things">Ignoring Things</h3>
<p>What if we have files that we do not want Mercurial to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Let's create a few dummy files:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ mkdir results
$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out</code></pre>
<p>and see what Mercurial says:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>? a.dat
? b.dat
? c.dat
? results/a.out
? results/b.out</code></pre>
<p>Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What's worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let's tell Mercurial to ignore them.</p>
<p>We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called <code>.hgignore</code>.</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ nano .hgignore
$ cat .hgignore</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>syntax: glob
*.dat
results/</code></pre>
<p>The <code>syntax: glob</code> line at the top of the file tells Mercurial that we want to use the same kind of pattern matching that we use in the shell (which is known as &quot;globbing&quot; and the patterns as &quot;globs&quot;). The second line tells Mercurial to ignore any file whose name ends in <code>.dat</code> and the third one to ignore everything in the <code>results</code> directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Mercurial would continue to track them.)</p>
<p>Once we have created this file, the output of <code>hg status</code> is much cleaner:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>? .hgignore</code></pre>
<p>The only thing Mercurial notices now is the newly-created <code>.hgignore</code> file. You might think we wouldn't want to track it, but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore the same things that we're ignoring. Let's add and commit <code>.hgignore</code>:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg add .hgignore
$ hg commit -m &quot;Add the ignore file&quot;
$ hg status</code></pre>
<p>We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ hg status --ignored</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>I a.dat
I b.dat
I c.dat
I results/a.out
I results/b.out</code></pre>
